/*Detail analysis description as per below.
There are a total of 1000 rows and 10 columns in the sales table, which is the database for this analysis.

Constraints analysis:
PRIMARY KEY constraint: The order_number column is designated as the primary key for the table. 
						This ensures that each row in the table is uniquely identified by its order_number value and prevents duplicate entries.
NOT NULL constraint: The date, quantity, unit_price, total, payment, and payment_fee columns cannot contain NULL values. 
					 This ensures that all required information is present for each order and prevents incomplete or invalid data in the table.
CHECK constraint: The positive_value constraint ensures that the unit_price and total columns have values greater than 0. 
				  This ensures that all prices and totals entered into the table are positive and prevents incorrect or invalid data.

Column Analysis:
1. order_number: There are 1000 unique rows.
2. date: The number of rows is 1000, as expected. The table contains data for three months: June 2021, July 2021, and August 2021.
3. warehouse: There are 1000 rows & three locations for warehouses 'West', 'North', and 'Central'.
4. client_type: There are 1000 rows & two types of clients, 'Wholesale' and 'Retail'.
5. product_line: There are 1000 rows & six types of product_line.
6. quantity: As expected, there are 1000 rows.
7. unit_price: As expected, there are 1000 rows. Each value of unit_price is above 0.
8. total: As expected, there are 1000 rows. Each value is above 0.
9. payment: There are three types of payment  Cash, Transfer, and Credit Card. This list contains no null values.
10.payment_fee: There are 1000 rows without null.*/

Specifically, it is calculating the minimum, maximum, average, 25th percentile, median (50th percentile), 75th percentile, 
95th percentile, and standard deviation of the "total" column for each month.
The results are then grouped and ordered by month. 
This analysis provides insights into the central tendency, variability, and range of the "total" column for each month.

Based on the output provided, here are some observations:

The "minimum" column shows the lowest total for each month, and it ranges from 10.35 to 10.92.
The "maximum" column shows the highest total for each month, and it ranges from 1827.04 to 2546.33.
The "average total" column shows the average value of the "total" column for each month, and it ranges from 271.15 to 316.23.
The "percentile_25" column shows the 25th percentile of the "total" column for each month, and it ranges from 89.80 to 95.52.
The "median_total" column shows the median value (50th percentile) of the "total" column for each month, and it ranges from 169.96 to 183.99.
The "percentile_75" column shows the 75th percentile of the "total" column for each month, and it ranges from 319.72 to 323.88.
The "percentile_95" column shows the 95th percentile of the "total" column for each month, and it ranges from 981.40 to 1213.13.
The "std_deviation" column shows the standard deviation of the "total" column for each month, and it ranges from 301.39 to 399.16.
